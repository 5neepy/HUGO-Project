I started this website for one reason. I was setting up my new pc and I decided that it will be running windows.
Bruhh I know, I know. When I installed the os I needed that thing that magically gives you an Ofice 2019 and Windows
10 product key. When I scout the web I wasn’t able to find anything (except malware). After 15 mins of search
I was set up and ready to start my first c++ project on the new machine.

**Software is made for the people and I think we deserve to have it. The point of the website is to provide you with the rarest/useful software out there**

I added some more cool things to not leave the page empty :)
Enjoy!
In the future, I will add more things to download, old and rare OSes, a blog for interesting and important tech news and maybe I don’t promise anything but maybe something more interesting will be added, something with .vir in the file name ;)
